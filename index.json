Motivated by this question, we aim at constructing an informative prior for held-out languages on the task of character-level, open-vocabulary language modeling. We obtain this prior as the posterior over network weights conditioned on the data from a sample of training languages, which is approximated through Laplace’s method. Based on a large and diverse sample of languages, the use of our prior outperforms baseline models with an uninformative prior in both zero-shot and few-shot settings, showing that the prior is imbued with universal linguistic knowledge. Moreover, we harness broad language-specific information available for most languages of the world, ie, features from typological databases, as distant supervision for held-out languages. We explore several language modeling conditioning techniques, including concatenation and metanetworks for parameter generation. They appear beneficial in the few-shot setting, but ineffective in the zero-shot setting. Since the paucity of even plain digital text affects the majority of the world’s languages, we hope that these insights will broaden the scope of applications for language technology.","tags":null,"title":"Towards Zero-shot Language Modeling","type":"publication"},{"authors":["alison"],"categories":["workshop"],"content":"\rA full-day workshop for  users who want to get more out of R Markdown (and friends).

However, such post-processing methods suffer from limited coverage as they affect only vectors of words seen in the external resources. We present the first postprocessing method that specializes vectors of all vocabulary words – including those unseen in the resources – for the asymmetric relation of lexical entailment (LE) (i.e., hyponymyhypernymy relation). Leveraging a partially LE-specialized distributional space, our POSTLE (i.e., post-specialization for LE) model learns an explicit global specialization function, allowing for specialization of vectors of unseen words, as well as word vectors from other languages via cross-lingual transfer. We capture the function as a deep feedforward neural network: its objective re-scales vector norms to reflect the concept hierarchy while simultaneously attracting hyponymyhypernymy pairs to better reflect semantic similarity. An extended model variant augments the basic architecture with an adversarial discriminator. We demonstrate the usefulness and versatility of POSTLE models with different input distributional spaces in different scenarios (monolingual LE and zero-shot cross-lingual LE transfer) and tasks (binary and graded LE). We report consistent gains over state-of-the-art LE-specialization methods, and successfully LE-specialize word vectors for languages without any external lexical knowledge.","tags":null,"title":"Specializing Distributional Vectors of All Words for Lexical Entailment","type":"publication"},{"authors":["alison"],"categories":["talk"],"content":"\rData science educators have a unique opportunity to teach students the skills they need in their future careers. We know that practical skills matter, like being able to wrangle, explore, analyze, and visualize data (preferably using code), but what is easy to overlook is teaching students how to communicate about data science with other people. Being able to communicate about data, code, and insights gained are important skills we can strengthen in the classroom to make a real impact on students. I will talk about three ways to help strengthen data science communication skills that matter: self-reflection, iteration, and broadcasting. Self-reflection involves asking students to reflect on concepts and/or code that they struggled with to increase engagement with materials and independent problem-solving. Iteration involves revisiting old concepts/code, identifying areas for improvement, and making them better, either independently or in collaboration with peers or other experts/advanced users. Broadcasting involves practice (practice, practice, practice) “wrapping up” code with words into coherent narratives about what a data analysis or visualization

While post-processing specialization methods are applicable to arbitrary distributional vectors, they are limited to updating only the vectors of words occurring in external lexicons (ie, seen words), leaving the vectors of all other words unchanged. We propose a novel approach to specializing the full distributional vocabulary. Our adversarial post-specialization method propagates the external lexical knowledge to the full distributional space. We exploit words seen in the resources as training examples for learning a global specialization function. This function is learned by combining a standard L2-distance loss with an adversarial loss: the adversarial component produces more realistic output vectors. We show the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method across three languages and on three tasks: word similarity, dialog state tracking, and lexical simplification. We report consistent improvements over distributional word vectors and vectors specialized by other state-of-the-art specialization frameworks. Finally, we also propose a cross-lingual transfer method for zero-shot specialization which successfully specializes a full target distributional space without any lexical knowledge in the target language and without any bilingual data.","tags":null,"title":"Adversarial Propagation and Zero-Shot Cross-Lingual Transfer of Word Vector Specialization","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"My blog posts are released under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.\n  \n","date":1530140400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1530140400,"objectID":"53e892b8b41cc4caece1cfd5ef21d6e7","permalink":"https://emponti.github.io/license/","publishdate":"2018-06-28T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/license/","section":"","summary":"My blog posts are released under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.","tags":null,"title":"LICENSE: CC-BY-SA","type":"page"},{"authors":["alison"],"categories":["talk","keynote"],"content":"Inspired by the book “Big Magic: Creative Living Beyond Fear” by Elizabeth Gilbert, Alison will talk about the five essential ingredients needed to creatively learn R and why these elements are also essential for advanced users to take their R skills to the next level.

We’ll talk about many low-level details in the rmarkdown package and the whole R Markdown ecosystem. The two goals of this workshop are: 1) learn how to fully customize R Markdown output (HTML, LaTeX/PDF, Word, and PowerPoint); and 2) learn more about existing R Markdown extensions in the ecosystem, such as flexdashboard, bookdown, blogdown, pkgdown, xaringan, rticles, and learnr. We will also talk about how to use or develop new language engines (languages that are not R), how to develop HTML widgets, and integrate Shiny with R Markdown.\nSee the workshop website for more, and links to individual slides below.\n","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"2a508153b3ae9e46d1a6cb1beb8234e0","permalink":"https://emponti.github.io/project/advanced-r-markdown/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/advanced-r-markdown/","section":"project","summary":"A two-day workshop for those who want to take their R Markdown skills to the next level","tags":["workshop","R","blogdown","xaringan","bookdown","flexdashboard","rmarkdown"],"title":"Advanced R Markdown","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"03abe4930dc106758dc82a0471258e90","permalink":"https://emponti.github.io/project/bakeoff/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/bakeoff/","section":"project","summary":"An R data package with data from “The Great British Bake Off”","tags":["R","software"],"title":"Bakeoff","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"c7297892dd13604a0e171a4f21c6c629","permalink":"https://emponti.github.io/project/blogdown-book/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/blogdown-book/","section":"project","summary":"A practical guide for creating websites using the blogdown package in R","tags":["book","blogdown","R"],"title":"blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown","type":"project"},{"authors":["alison"],"categories":["course"],"content":"Part of a year-long curricula on open science, data, and research practice for incoming graduate students in the biomedical sciences, developed in collaboration with OHSU School of MedicineGraduate Studies.
