      <title>Teaching Students to Talk about Data Science</title>

&lt;p&gt;Data science educators have a unique opportunity to teach students the skills they need in their future careers. We know that practical skills matter, like being able to wrangle, explore, analyze, and visualize data (preferably using code), but what is easy to overlook is teaching students how to communicate about data science with other people. Being able to communicate about data, code, and insights gained are important skills we can strengthen in the classroom to make a real impact on students. I will talk about three ways to help strengthen data science communication skills that matter: self-reflection, iteration, and broadcasting. Self-reflection involves asking students to reflect on concepts and/or code that they struggled with to increase engagement with materials and independent problem-solving. Iteration involves revisiting old concepts/code, identifying areas for improvement, and making them better, either independently or in collaboration with peers or other experts/advanced users. Broadcasting involves practice (practice, practice, practice) “wrapping up” code with words into coherent narratives about what a data analysis or visualization means.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Data Visualization in the Tidyverse</title>
      <link>https://ducdauge.github.io/talk/2018-uo-plotoff/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Using one dataset from The Great British Bake Off, I show eleven ways to visualize one dataset using eleven different versions of &amp;ldquo;tidy data.&amp;rdquo; Take-away messages:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tidy data is the start of your data wrangling journey, not the end&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is not a single &amp;ldquo;tidy&amp;rdquo; version of a dataset&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tidy data &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; make you more nimble!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Big Magic with R: Creative Learning Beyond Fear</title>
      <link>https://ducdauge.github.io/talk/2018-cascadia-bigmagic/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Inspired by the book “Big Magic: Creative Living Beyond Fear” by Elizabeth Gilbert, Alison will talk about the five essential ingredients needed to creatively learn R and why these elements are also essential for advanced users to take their R skills to the next level. You will hear practical advice for when, where, and how to start a project in R, and how your learning can add value- both to your own knowledge and to contribute to the larger community of R learners. Along the way, she will share recommended resources and evidence-based strategies for project-based learning. Alison’s background working with both new and advanced R users gives her a unique perspective on this topic.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Take a Sad Plot &amp; Make It Better</title>
      <link>https://ducdauge.github.io/talk/2018-ohsu-sad-plot-better/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Join us on April 6 for a walk-through of how to take a sad plot and make it better by Alison Hill, who co-teaches the CS631 Data Visualization course. Alison will take us through one plot’s life cycle, from a sad Powerpoint slide to an Excel chart and finally to the finished product made with the ggplot2 package in R. We will discuss why each version of the plot fails in different ways, how each iteration improved on the last one, and which data visualization principles are at work in the final plot to communicate a clear scientific story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following this, Eric Earl (Senior RA in the DCAN Labs) will show a case study of visualization in neuroimaging research.&lt;/p&gt;
